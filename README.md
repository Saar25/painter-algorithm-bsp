# Painter Algorithm with BSP

A visualization of the Painter's Algorithm using Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) Trees

## ðŸŒ³ What is This?

This project demonstrates how the Painterâ€™s Algorithm can be implemented using BSP trees. It's inspired by the concepts in computational geometry, particularly from _Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications_ by de Berg et al.
